# OTC API Service

Backend API for the Pearl OTC settlement desk.

## Responsibility

- Quote creation and acceptance.
- Trade lifecycle API.
- User/session boundary.
- Public proof endpoint.
- Admin/dispute API.
- Persistence for quotes, trades, events, and audit log.

## Should Not Own

- Pearl chain ingestion. Use `services/pearl-indexer`.
- Base log ingestion. Use the USDC escrow client/worker path.
- Frontend state decisions. Expose canonical state from backend events.

## Status

Scaffold only. First implementation should be a small NestJS service using the shared SDK types.
